Year of our Lord, 1756. A small group of colonists arrives in Boston on the merchant vessel Spirit of Aberdeen. They build their houses in the swamps of Back Bay and receive many mosquito bites. Among these highly infested pioneers is the Dreadawful family, known for their expertise in machinations, cocktails, Hegelian pontifications, assassinations, and proto-hierarchical raytracing.

The new colonists live peaceful lives for all of three days. Rather suddenly, a horrendous explosion rips apart the causality of the Back Bay Fens and, when the meta-dust settles, the only survivors are the Dreadawfuls. Contemporary police are unable to determine what caused the blast; even in the modern day, the post-modern shockwaves are too powerful for historians to make much sense of the events. There is no doubt, however, that the ever-mysterious, ever-powerful Dreadawfuls were responsible for the calamity.

The Dreadawfuls establish themselves as cloth merchants and thereafter drift out of the public eye while establishing Shadow Boston, a secret Boston within this one that is somehow more brutal and colder. Through Shadow Boston, they are able to secure their hold on our more utopic Boston while making themselves aware to all but a handful of people.

This happy arrangement continues for some time, and the family fortune grows to be enormous. Despite some really stupid financial decisions, like Joe Dreadawful's investment into the Nantucket independence movement in the War of 1812, the family is overall quite successful.

Then, the Great War came, and almost all of the family was wiped out at the Battle of the Somme. Shadow Boston disappeared in a Bitter Pillar of Cynicism and Disillusion. By Year of our Lord 2013, the family is reduced to Uncle Pete Dreadawful and his niece Sam, a trans* person of indefinite age but whom but all accounts looks to be around seven years old.
